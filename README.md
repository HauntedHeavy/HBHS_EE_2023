# Huntington Beach High Automotive Engineering Club - UCI Energy Invitational 2023
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the HBHS entry in the UCI Energy Invitational Competition. This project involves building an electric vehicle to compete in an efficiency race. The goal is to create a vehicle that can travel the furthest distance with the least amount of energy, in the shortest amount of time.

## Project Overview
The project consists of several components, including:

Electrical schematics: These documents show the wiring and connections between the various components in the vehicle, including the motor controller, batteries, and sensors.

Code: The code controls the various systems in the vehicle, including the motor, throttle, brakes, and steering. It is written in C++ and runs on an Arduino microcontroller.

CAD drawings: The CAD drawings show the design of the vehicle, including the chassis, body, and other components. They were created using Autodesk Fusion 360.

Bill of materials: The bill of materials lists all the components used in the vehicle, including part numbers, quantities, and prices.

## Components of this Repository
This repository contains various components that we worked on during the 2023 competition:

1. CAD drawings (using [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/)) of various components and parts we needed to manufacture.
2. Electrical Schematics and Block Diagrams
3. Arduino Software for Vehicle #1: Utilizing the [Cytron SmartDrive MDDS60](https://www.cytron.io/p-60amp-7v-45v-smartdrive-dc-motor-driver-2-channels) Motor Driver.
4. Arduino Software for Vehicle #2: Utilizing the [Cytron MD30C Motor Driver](https://www.cytron.io/c-motor-and-motor-driver/c-motor-driver/p-30amp-5v-30v-dc-motor-driver).
5. Python Software used to perform preliminary performance analysis.
